/**
 * Class for controlling SSL/TLS encryption over TCP/IP connections.
 *
 * The SSLConn class is derived from the TCPConn class, which itself
 * is dervived from the IPComm class.  It only adds three additional
 * data member: the OpenSSL object, the peer certificate (if we
 * received one), and a flag to show what state we are in (useful for
 * terminating the connection).  Several of TCP connectoin-oriented
 * functions, e.g., bind(), listen(), accept(), connect(), read() and
 * write() are overwritten.  This class can be used by itself, or as
 * the base class to higher-layer abstractions, e.g., SSLSession.
