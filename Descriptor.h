/**
 *  Class for controlling (file) descriptor reference counts.
 *
 * This class provides a mechanism to track the number of refernces to
 * a file descriptor, such that, prior to destructing this class (in
 * the parent class), the reference count can be checked to see if
 * it's safe to close(2) (or fclose(3)) the descriptor (and also,
 * delete this object).
 *
 * This class is *NOT* to be used as a base class (@see RefCount for
 * derviving classes off of a reference counting object), as we can
 * not implement a copy constructor (simply because we can't change
 * the ref count in the const src parameter), which is required for
 * STL.
 *
 * Thus, the parent class is responsible for incrementing and
 * decrementing the ref count in its destructor, copy constructor and
 * assignment operator.  If the ref count is 0, the parent is then
 * also responsible for destructing the Descriptor class (after
 * closing the descriptor!).  I repeat, it's the onus of the parent to
 * INCREMENT & DECREMENT Discriptor's ref count in the parent's copy
 * constructor, assignment operator and destructor, and then see if
 * the Descriptor object should be deleted!
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * - If the descriptor is opened for streaming I/O, then fd_ remains
 * DESCRIPTOR_NULL and we use fp_.
 *
 * - We could either make the data members public in here, or we need
 * to declare the parent classes as friends to this class.  We chose
 * the latter, for the number of classes that would want to use this
 * class are finite and tractable.
