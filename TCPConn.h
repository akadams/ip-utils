/**
 * Class for controlling TCP/IP connections.
 *
 * The TCPConn class is derived from the IPComm class.  It only adds
 * one additional data member (a flag to show if both sides of the
 * connection are in a *connected* state), but it provides several
 * methods that are used within TCP connectoin-oriented protocol,
 * e.g., bind(), listen(), accept(), and connect().  This class can be
 * used by itself, or as the base class to higher-layer abstractions,
 * e.g., TCPSession.
