/** Class to act as a handler for the framing used in network communications.
 *
 *  The MsgHdr class acts as an opaque container for the type of
 *  framing used in a network session; certain framing information is
 *  necessary for *session managing* classes, e.g., TCPSession, to
 *  process messages (e.g., to know when the message is complete), but
 *  additional application layer information stored in the framing
 *  header, e.g., Content-Type, is not necessary for the session
 *  manager -- in fact, that information may not be used until the
 *  message is processed by the application layer.  Thus, MsgHdr must
 *  be aware of all possible message framing protocols, e.g., HTTP,
 *  MIME, etc., that the network session (e.g., TCPSession) will use,
 *  but in only needs to provide a finite absraction to those classes
 *  for the session managers (providing that the framing classes all
 *  use the same API!).
 *
 *  MsgHdr (and event-loop processing code) only needs to operate in
 *  two modes, regardless of how many type of framing we have.  That
 *  is, class-based or struct-based modes.  Class-based mode simply
 *  requires the higher-layer code like the event-loop to use a
 *  member-function or method of the framing class to accomplish some
 *  task, e.g., use the class' copy constructors.  In struct-based
 *  mode we use memory functions to operate on the framing struct,
 *  e.g., memcpy(). In short, HTTPFraming would be class-based, while
 *  BasicFraming would be struct-based.  It is imporant that when a
 *  user adds a framing class to MsgHdr they set the correct type of
 *  operation mode in IsClassBased().
 *
 *  TODO(aka) At some point we should chnage struct framing_hdr into a
 *  Class.  Additionally, it would probably be nice to be able to
 *  return whatever framing header we had via a void* in the getter
 *  funtion(s), so that code use higher layer classes, e.g.,
 *  TCPSession, could actually use the header directly
 *  "tcp_session.hdr().print_status()".  Currently, the higher-layer
 *  codes has to get a copy of the struct, e.g., "HTTPFraming http_hdr
 *  = tcp_session.hdr();" and then access the HTTP information.
 *  Moreover, if you want to change any information within the struct
 *  via TCPSession, you need to overwrite the entire struct in MsgHdr.
 *
 *  If this was a Java class, as opposed to a C++ class, it would
 *  probably be called FramingWrapper or some such ... it's arguable
 *  whether that is a more descriptive name.
 *
 *  Note, it is expected that as framing classes get added to this
 *  library, this class will be updated to reflect that.
